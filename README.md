## Overview

Cinder is a hobby chess engine written in Rust.

## Getting started

### Prebuilt binaries

Prebuilt binaries for various popular platforms and CPU architectures are available on
the [releases] page.

#### Which binary to download?

Use the tables below as a reference for which binary to pick.
The table is ordered from most compatible to most performant.
You should prefer the most performant binary that runs on your machine.

| Suffix    | Description                                                      |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sse4`    | Compatible with most Intel and AMD CPUs                          |
| `avx2`    | Compatible with Intel Haswell (2013+) and AMD Excavator (2015+)  |
| `avx512`  | Compatible with Intel Skylake-X (2017+) and AMD Zen 4 (2022+)    |
| `vnni512` | Compatible with Intel Cascade Lake (2019+) and AMD Zen 4 (2022+) |
| `neon`    | Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3                                           |
| `sme`     | Apple Silicon M4+                                                |

### Building from source

Building Cinder from source currently requires a recent nightly Rust compiler, and [cargo-pgo].

#### Installing the latest nightly Rust toolchain

```sh
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
```

#### Installing `cargo-pgo`

```sh
cargo install cargo-pgo
```

#### Building Cinder optimized for your CPU architecture

```sh
make
```

You will find the compiled binary under `target/bin/`.

### Usage

Cinder implements the UCI protocol and should be compatible with most chess graphical user
interfaces (GUI). Users who are familiar with the UCI protocol may also interact with Cinder
directly on a terminal via its command line interface (CLI).
